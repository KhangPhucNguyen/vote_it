Vote It
============

Everyday, in my office, we have to face with so many decisions some of which are not easy to make or need the most number of accords such as: Where are we going out for this weekend? Which topic do you like most for this week techtalk? Which girl is the most "handsome" one in the office *LOL*? etc... And everytime this happens we have to stand in the circle and discuss about it, which waste much time and not funny at all. Finally I just realize that we are engineer, then why we have to suffer to our laziness and bore? So this idea come in my mind for an internal vote it system.

Of course you can easily to find many voting services on the internet. However, they all look "gray", blue, and lack of some essential features. And accidentally I have all the neccessary tools in my box, then I build this one :D.

 Main feature:
 - Create votes, vote sets.
 - Manage vote (activate, remove)
 - See the overview of votes.
 - Publish the result.
